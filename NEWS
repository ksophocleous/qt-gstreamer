qt-gstreamer 1.2.0 (2014-07-08)
===============================

    * Initial port to the GStreamer 1.0 series (BREAKS API & ABI)

Further additions:
    * Added QtQuick2 support, which includes:
      - The qtquick2videosink gstreamer element
      - The QtGStreamerQuick2 QML plugin
      - The Qt5GStreamerQuick glue library
      - The qmlplayer2 example

Packaging changes:
    * Tarballs are now distributed in .tar.xz format, together
      with a .tar.xz.sha256sum check file, like the rest of the
      GStreamer modules.
    * Package is NOT fully co-installable with QtGStreamer 0.10.3

Versioning changes:
    * Version numbers are now going to be synced to the GStreamer API
      that qt-gstreamer targets, to avoid confusion. So, this release,
      instead of being version 1.0.0, it is 1.2.0.

qt-gstreamer 0.10.3 (2013-10-14)
==================================

Additions:
    * Added Qt5 support.
    * Added GstDiscoverer bindings.
    * QGlib::Error can now be used in QGlib::Value
    * Added convenience constructors for QGst::ClockTime

Fixes:
    * Fixed qtglvideosink painting on QGLFrameBufferObject
    * Fixed codegen compilation with bison 2.6
    * Fixed example code in the QGst::Ui::GraphicsVideoSurface apidocs
    * Many fixes for windows support

Build system fixes and enhancements:
    * Use recent cmake goodies:
      * CMakePackageConfigHelpers, which simplifies QtGStreamerConfig.cmake
        and adds version checking in find_package(QtGStreamer)
      * CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE, which eliminates issues with
        missing -fPIC / -fPIE
      * GNUInstallDirs, which adds automagic support for debian multiarch
        and also takes away the need for LIB_SUFFIX
    * .dll's are now installed in the correct place ($prefix/bin) on windows
    * cmake config files are now installed in $libdir/cmake/$package
      instead of $libdir/$package
    * Renamed signal.h to qglib_signal.h to avoid problems where the compiler
      mixes it up with the C <signal.h>
    * Determine whether to use OpenGLES or desktop OpenGL by looking at
      what Qt is using on the target system instead of guessing.

Changes in dependencies:
    * CMake 2.8.9 is now required
    * Drop completely automoc dependency in favor of cmake's internal automoc
    * Qt5 can be used instead of Qt4. The resulting qt-gstreamer files
        will be co-installable with the ones built using Qt4.

qt-gstreamer 0.10.2 (2012-04-15)
================================

Additions:
    * Added qHash(const RefPointer<T> &) function.
    * Added Element::removePad() and Pad::setActive() methods.
    * Added extra documentation about the design of the wrapping system.
    * Added new examples: VoIP and QMLPlayer.
    * Added new elements: qtvideosink and qtglvideosink.
    * Added helper classes for painting video on QGraphicsView.
    * Added QML plugin that provides an item for painting video.

Fixes:
    * Fixed compilation with newer glib versions.
    * Fixed compilation with boost 1.48 (QTBUG-22829).
    * Fixed compilation with -DQT_NO_STL.
    * Fixed Element::unlink() to work correctly.
    * Fixed Structure::fromString() to actually compile.

Build system fixes and enhancements:
    * Utils/global.h is now properly installed.
    * Support lib64.
    * Support installing gstreamer plugins in the plugin directory indicated by pkg-config.
    * Support cmake's internal automoc.
    * Fixed error output when automoc4 is required and not found.
    * Fixed cross-compilation issues.
    * Made all examples compilable standalone with both qmake and cmake.
    * Fixed FindGObject.cmake not to use pkg-config variables directly.
    * Fixed UseDoxygen.cmake to not output latex docs by default.

Changes in dependencies:
    * GStreamer 0.10.33 is now required.
    * Qt 4.7 is now required.
    * Flex and bison are no longer required.
    * Automoc is no longer a mandatory dependency, if cmake >= 2.8.6 is present.
