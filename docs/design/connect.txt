connect() is a template method. When it is used, it takes the arguments of the given
slot and instantiates a template marshaller that is responsible for converting
the GValues that the signal provides to the C++ types that the slot expects.
This marshaller and the structure holding the receiver & slot are then attached on
the data of a GClosure and this GClosure is connected to the signal.
